	<h1>"No teacher should have to worry about not being able to provide the most basic resources for their students."</h1>
	<p>Iâ€™ve been a teacher for eight years and have worked in two high-poverty public schools. In South Carolina, I never had enough novels to allow my kids to take them home and read them.
    I had to pay out-of-pocket for items like tissues, hand sanitizer and dry-erase markers. I was also only allowed a certain number of photocopies each semester. If I ran out of copies, I had to pay for more. I would play math games in my head: If I made the font smaller and reduced the spacing and margins, I could reduce the amount of copies per child to two pages instead, and I would have more copies left for another story on another day. I became a master at the art of formatting assignments when I should have been spending time mastering the content. <br>
